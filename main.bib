	Abstract = {RecQ DNA helicases are critical enzymes for the maintenance of genome integrity. Here, we determined the first DNA complex structures, to our knowledge, of the human RECQ1 helicase. These structures provide new insight into the RecQ helicase mechanism of DNA tracking, strand separation, strand annealing, and Holliday junction (HJ) branch migration. We identified a surface region in the winged-helix domain of RECQ1 that is important for both dsDNA recognition and HJ resolution, and we used a combination of biochemical, analytical ultracentrifugation, and EM experiments to begin elucidating the molecular basis of the distinct HJ resolution activities of human RecQ helicases.RecQ helicases are a widely conserved family of ATP-dependent motors with diverse roles in nearly every aspect of bacterial and eukaryotic genome maintenance. However, the physical mechanisms by which RecQ helicases recognize and process specific DNA replication and repair intermediates are largely unknown. Here, we solved crystal structures of the human RECQ1 helicase in complexes with tailed-duplex DNA and ssDNA. The structures map the interactions of the ssDNA tail and the branch point along the helicase and Zn-binding domains, which, together with reported structures of other helicases, define the catalytic stages of helicase action. We also identify a strand-separating pin, which (uniquely in RECQ1) is buttressed by the protein dimer interface. A duplex DNA-binding surface on the C-terminal domain is shown to play a role in DNA unwinding, strand annealing, and Holliday junction (HJ) branch migration. We have combined EM and analytical ultracentrifugation approaches to show that RECQ1 can form what appears to be a flat, homotetrameric complex and propose that RECQ1 tetramers are involved in HJ recognition. This tetrameric arrangement suggests a platform for coordinated activity at the advancing and receding duplexes of an HJ during branch migration.},

	Abstract = {RecQ family helicases catalyze critical genome maintenance reactions in bacterial and eukaryotic cells, playing key roles in several DNA metabolic processes. Mutations in recQ genes are linked to genome instability and human disease. To define the physical basis of RecQ enzyme function, we have determined a 1.8 {\AA} resolution crystal structure of the catalytic core of Escherichia coli RecQ in its unbound form and a 2.5 {\AA} resolution structure of the core bound to the ATP analog ATPÎ³S. The RecQ core comprises four conserved subdomains; two of these combine to form its helicase region, while the others form unexpected Zn2+-binding and winged-helix motifs. The structures reveal the molecular basis of missense mutations that cause Bloom's syndrome, a human RecQ-associated disease. Finally, based on findings from the structures, we propose a mechanism for RecQ activity that could explain its functional coordination with topoisomerase III.},

	Abstract = {Lentiviral vectors (LV) have seen considerably increase in use as gene therapy vectors for the treatment of acquired and inherited diseases. This review presents the state of the art of the production of these vectors with particular emphasis on their large-scale production for clinical purposes. In contrast to oncoretroviral vectors, which are produced using stable producer cell lines, clinical-grade LV are in most of the cases produced by transient transfection of 293 or 293T cells grown in cell factories. However, more recent developments, also, tend to use hollow fiber reactor, suspension culture processes, and the implementation of stable producer cell lines. As is customary for the biotech industry, rather sophisticated downstream processing protocols have been established to remove any undesirable process-derived contaminant, such as plasmid or host cell DNA or host cell proteins. This review compares published large-scale production and purification processes of LV and presents their process performances. Furthermore, developments in the domain of stable cell lines and their way to the use of production vehicles of clinical material will be presented.},

	Abstract = {Protein folding is a highly complex process proceeding through a number of disordered and partially folded nonnative states with various degrees of structural organization. These transiently and sparsely populated species on the protein folding energy landscape play crucial roles in driving folding toward the native conformation, yet some of these nonnative states may also serve as precursors for protein misfolding and aggregation associated with a range of devastating diseases, including neuro-degeneration, diabetes and cancer. Therefore, in vivo protein folding is often reshaped co- and post-translationally through interactions with the ribosome, molecular chaperones and/or other cellular components. Owing to developments in instrumentation and methodology, solution NMR spectroscopy has emerged as the central experimental approach for the detailed characterization of the complex protein folding processes in vitro and in vivo. NMR relaxation dispersion and saturation transfer methods provide the means for a detailed characterization of protein folding kinetics and thermodynamics under native-like conditions, as well as modeling high-resolution structures of weakly populated short-lived conformational states on the protein folding energy landscape. Continuing development of isotope labeling strategies and NMR methods to probe high molecular weight protein assemblies, along with advances of in-cell NMR, have recently allowed protein folding to be studied in the context of ribosome-nascent chain complexes and molecular chaperones, and even inside living cells. Here we review solution NMR approaches to investigate the protein folding energy landscape, and discuss selected applications of NMR methodology to studying protein folding in vitro and in vivo. Together, these examples highlight a vast potential of solution NMR in providing atomistic insights into molecular mechanisms of protein folding and homeostasis in health and disease.},

	Abstract = {Protein interactions inside the human body are expected to differ from the situation in vitro. This is crucial when investigating protein functions or developing new drugs. In this study, we present a sample-efficient, free-solution method, termed microscale thermophoresis, that is capable of analysing interactions of proteins or small molecules in biological liquids such as blood serum or cell lysate. The technique is based on the thermophoresis of molecules, which provides information about molecule size, charge and hydration shell. We validated the method using immunologically relevant systems including human interferon gamma and the interaction of calmodulin with calcium. The affinity of the small-molecule inhibitor quercetin to its kinase PKA was determined in buffer and human serum, revealing a 400-fold reduced affinity in serum. This information about the influence of the biological matrix may allow to make more reliable conclusions on protein functionality, and may facilitate more efficient drug development.},

We solved a 2.8-{\AA}resolution crystal structure of human Wnt3 in complex with mouse Frizzled 8 Cys-rich domain (CRD). Wnt3 grabs the receptor in a manner very similar to that found in Xenopus Wnt8 complexed with the same receptor. Unlike Xenopus Wnt8-bound CRD, however, Wnt3-bound CRD formed a symmetrical dimer in the crystal by exchanging the tip of the unsaturated acyl chain attached to each Wnt3, confirming the ability of Wnt and Frizzled CRD to form a 2:2 complex. The hypervariable `linker'region of Wnt3 formed a Î²-hairpin protrusion opposite from the Frizzled binding interface, consistent with its proposed role in the coreceptor recognition. Direct binding between this segment and the Wnt coreceptor LRP6 was confirmed, enabling us to build a structural model of the Wnt--Frizzled--LRP6 ternary complex.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase is a remarkable energy transducer that seems to work almost purely by Coulombic principles without the need for significant protein conformational changes. In recent years it has become possible to follow key partial reactions of the catalytic cycle in real time, both with respect to electron and proton movements. These experiments have largely set the stage for the proton pump mechanism. The structures of the catalytic binuclear hemeâcopper site that is common to the huge family of hemeâcopper oxidases, are today well understood throughout the catalytic cycle of oxygen reduction to water based on both spectroscopic studies and quantum chemical calculations. Here, we briefly review this progress, and add some recent details into how the proton pump mechanism is protected from failure by leakage.},

	N2 = {Photosynthesis is limited by the slow relaxation of nonphotochemical quenching, which primarily dissipates excess absorbed light energy as heat. Because the heat dissipation process is proportional to light-driven thylakoid lumen acidification, manipulating thylakoid ion and proton flux via transport proteins could improve photosynthesis. However, an important aspect of the current understanding of the thylakoid ion transportome is inaccurate. Using fluorescent protein fusions, we show that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) two-pore K+ channel TPK3, which had been reported to mediate thylakoid K+ flux, localizes to the tonoplast, not the thylakoid. The localization of TPK3 outside of the thylakoids is further supported by the absence of TPK3 in isolated thylakoids as well as the inability of isolated chloroplasts to import TPK3 protein. In line with the subcellular localization of TPK3 in the vacuole, we observed that photosynthesis in the Arabidopsis null mutant tpk3-1, which carries a transfer DNA insertion in the first exon, remains unaffected. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how thylakoid ion flux impacts photosynthetic efficiency under dynamic growth light regimes, we performed long-term photosynthesis imaging of established and newly isolated transthylakoid K+- and Clâ-flux mutants. Our results underpin the importance of the thylakoid ion transport proteins potassium cation efflux antiporter KEA3 and voltage-dependent chloride channel VCCN1 and suggest that the activity of yet unknown K+ channel(s), but not TPK3, is critical for optimal photosynthesis in dynamic light environments.},

	N2 = {In oxidative phosphorylation, complex I (NADH:quinone oxidoreductase) couples electron transfer to proton translocation across an energy-transducing membrane. Complex I contains a flavin mononucleotide to oxidize NADH, and an unusually long series of iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters, in several subunits, to transfer the electrons to quinone. Understanding coupled electron transfer in complex I requires a detailed knowledge of the properties of individual clusters and of the cluster ensemble, and so it requires the correlation of spectroscopic and structural data: This has proved a challenging task. EPR studies on complex I from Bos taurus have established that EPR signals N1b, N2 and N3 arise, respectively, from the 2Fe cluster in the 75 kDa subunit, and from 4Fe clusters in the PSST and 51 kDa subunits (positions 2, 7, and 1 along the seven-cluster chain extending from the flavin). The other clusters have either evaded detection or definitive signal assignments have not been established. Here, we combine double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy on B. taurus complex I with the structure of the hydrophilic domain of Thermus thermophilus complex I. By considering the magnetic moments of the clusters and the orientation selectivity of the DEER experiment explicitly, signal N4 is assigned to the first 4Fe cluster in the TYKY subunit (position 5), and N5 to the all-cysteine ligated 4Fe cluster in the 75 kDa subunit (position 3). The implications of our assignment for the mechanisms of electron transfer and energy transduction by complex I are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The mitochondrial inner membrane has a complex and dynamic structure that plays an important role in the function of this organelle. The internal compartments called cristae are created by processes that are just beginning to be understood. Crista size and morphology influence the internal diffusion of solutes and the surface area of the inner membrane, which is home to critical membrane proteins including ATP synthase and electron transport chain complexes; metabolite and ion transporters including the adenine nucleotide translocase, the calcium uniporter (MCU), and the sodium/calcium exchanger (NCLX); and many more. Here we provide a brief overview of what is known about crista structure and formation, and discuss mitochondrial function in the context of that structure. We also suggest that mathematical modeling of mitochondria that incorporates accurate information about the organelle's internal architecture can lead to a better understanding of its diverse functions.

	Abstract = {Proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the largest and most complicated enzyme of the respiratory chain. Fourteen central subunits represent the minimal form of complex I and can be assigned to functional modules for NADH oxidation, ubiquinone reduction, and proton pumping. In addition, the mitochondrial enzyme comprises some 30 accessory subunits surrounding the central subunits that are not directly associated with energy conservation. Complex I is known to release deleterious oxygen radicals (ROS) and its dysfunction has been linked to a number of hereditary and degenerative diseases. We here review recent progress in structure determination, and in understanding the role of accessory subunits and functional analysis of mitochondrial complex I. For the central subunits, structures provide insight into the arrangement of functional modules including the substrate binding sites, redox-centers and putative proton channels and pump sites. Only for two of the accessory subunits, detailed structures are available. Nevertheless, many of them could be localized in the overall structure of complex I, but most of these assignments have to be considered tentative. Strikingly, redox reactions and proton pumping machinery are spatially completely separated and the site of reduction for the hydrophobic substrate ubiquinone is found deeply buried in the hydrophilic domain of the complex. The X-ray structure of complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica provides clues supporting the previously proposed two-state stabilization change mechanism, in which ubiquinone redox chemistry induces conformational states and thereby drives proton pumping. The same structural rearrangements may explain the active/deactive transition of complex I implying an integrated mechanistic model for energy conversion and regulation.

	Abstract = {Respiration is one of the most basic features of living organisms, and the electron transport chain complexes are probably the most complicated protein system in mitochondria. Complex-IV is the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain, existing either as randomly scattered complexes or as a component of supercomplexes. NDUFA4 was previously assumed as a subunit of complex-I, but recent biochemical data suggested it may be a subunit of complex-IV. However, no structural evidence supporting this notion was available till now. Here we obtained the 3.3 {\AA}resolution structure of complex-IV derived from the human supercomplex I1III2IV1 and assigned the NDUFA4 subunit into complex-IV. Intriguingly, NDUFA4 lies exactly at the dimeric interface observed in previously reported crystal structures of complex-IV homodimer which would preclude complex-IV dimerization. Combining previous structural and biochemical data shown by us and other groups, we propose that the intact complex-IV is a monomer containing 14 subunits.},

Electrons moved freely within and between monomers, crossing an electron-transfer bridge between two hemes in the core of the dimer. This revealed an H-shaped electron-transfer system that distributes electrons between four quinone oxidation-reduction terminals at the corners of the dimer within the millisecond time scale of enzymatic turnover.

	Abstract = {Complex I is the first and largest enzyme of the respiratory chain, coupling electron transfer between NADH and ubiquinone to the translocation of four protons across the membrane. It has a central role in cellular energy production and has been implicated in many human neurodegenerative diseases. The L-shaped enzyme consists of hydrophilic and membrane domains. Previously, we determined the structure of the hydrophilic domain. Here we report the crystal structure of the Esherichia coli complex I membrane domain at 3.0 {\AA}resolution. It includes six subunits, NuoL, NuoM, NuoN, NuoA, NuoJ and NuoK, with 55 transmembrane helices. The fold of the homologous antiporter-like subunits L, M and N is novel, with two inverted structural repeats of five transmembrane helices arranged, unusually, face-to-back. Each repeat includes a discontinuous transmembrane helix and forms half of a channel across the membrane. A network of conserved polar residues connects the two half-channels, completing the proton translocation pathway. Unexpectedly, lysines rather than carboxylate residues act as the main elements of the proton pump in these subunits. The fourth probable proton-translocation channel is at the interface of subunits N, K, J and A. The structure indicates that proton translocation in complex I, uniquely, involves coordinated conformational changes in six symmetrical structural elements.},

	Abstract = {The single, simple concept that natural selection adjusts distances between redox cofactors goes a long way towards encompassing natural electron transfer protein design. Distances are short or long as required to direct or insulate promiscuously tunneling single electrons. Along a chain, distances are usually 14 {\AA}or less. Shorter distances are needed to allow climbing of added energetic barriers at paired-electron catalytic centers in which substrate and the required number of cofactors form a compact cluster. When there is a short-circuit danger, distances between shorting centers are relatively long. Distances much longer than 14{\AA}will support only very slow electron tunneling, but could act as high impedance signals useful in regulation. Tunneling simulations of the respiratory complexes provide clear illustrations of this simple engineering.},

	Abstract = {Cell membrane capacitance and conductance are key pieces of intrinsic information correlated with the cellular dielectric parameters and morphology of the plasma membrane; these parameters have been used as electrophysiological biomarkers to characterize cellular phenotype and state, and they have many associated clinical applications. Here, we present our work on the non-invasive determination of cell membrane capacitance and conductance by an optically activated microfluidics chip. The model for determining the cell membrane capacitance and conductance was established by a single layer of the shell-core polarization model. Three-dimensional finite-element analyses of the positive and negative optically induced dielectrophoresis forces generated by the projected light arrays of spots were performed, thus providing a theoretical validation of the feasibility of this approach. Then, the crossover frequency spectra for four typical types of cells (Raji cells, MCF-7 cells, HEK293 cells, and K562 cells) were experimentally investigated by using a micro-vision based motion-tracking technique. The different responses of these cells to the positive and negative ODEP forces were studied under four different liquid conductivities by automatic observation and tracking of the cellular trajectory and texture during the cells'translation. The cell membrane capacitance and conductance were determined from the curve-fitted spectra, which were 11.1 $\pm$0.9 mF/m2 and 782 $\pm$32 S/m2, respectively, for Raji cells, 11.5 $\pm$0.8 mF/m2 and 114 $\pm$28 S/m2 for MCF-7 cells, 9.0 $\pm$0.9 mF/m2 and 187 $\pm$22 S/m2 for HEK293 cells, and 10.2 $\pm$0.7 mF/m2 and 879 $\pm$24 S/m2 for K562 cells. Furthermore, as an application of this technique, the membrane capacitances of MCF-7 cells treated with four different concentrations of drugs were acquired. This technique introduces a determination of cell membrane capacitance and conductance that yields statistically significant data while allowing information from individual cells to be obtained in a non-invasive manner.},

	Abstract = {Fluorescence measurements of pH and other analytes in the cell rely on accurate calibrations, but these have routinely used algorithms that inadequately describe the properties of indicators. Here, we have established a more accurate method for calibrating and analyzing data obtained using the ratiometric probe 5(6)-carboxy-SNARF-1. We tested the implications of novel approach to measurements of pH in yeast mitochondria, a compartment containing a small number of free H+ ions. Our findings demonstrate that 5(6)-carboxy-SNARF-1 interacts with H+ ions inside the mitochondria in an anticooperative manner (Hill coefficient n of 0.5) and the apparent pH inside the mitochondria is ~0.5 unit lower than had been generally assumed. This result, at odds with the current consensus on the mechanism of energy generation in the mitochondria, is in better agreement with theoretical considerations and warrants further studies of organellar pH.},

	Abstract = {{1. Pulses of acidity of the outer aqueous phase of rat liver mitochondrial suspensions induced by pulses of respiration are due to the translocation of H+ (or OHâ) ions across the osmotic barrier (M phase) of the cristae membrane and cannot be attributed to the formation (with acid production) of a chemical intermediate that subsequently decomposes. 2. The effective quantity of protons translocated per bivalent reducing equivalent passing through the succinate-oxidizing and Î²-hydroxybutyrate-oxidizing spans of the respiratory chain are very close to 4 and 6 respectively. These quotients are constant between pH5Â·5 and 8Â·5 and are independent of changes in the ionic composition of the mitochondrial suspension medium provided that the conditions permit the accurate experimental measurement of the proton translocation. 3. Apparent changes in the âH+/O quotients may be induced by conditions preventing the occurrence of the usual backlash; these apparent changes of âH+/O are attributable to a very fast electrically driven component of the decay of the acid pulses that is not included in the experimental extrapolations. 4. Apparent changes in the âH+/O quotients may also be induced by the presence of anions, such as succinate, malonate and phosphate, or by cations such as Na+. These apparent changes of âH+/O are due to an increase in the rate of the pH-driven decay of the acid pulses. 5. The uncoupling agents, 2,4-dinitrophenol, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and gramicidin increase the effective proton conductance of the M phase and thus increase the rate of decay of the respiration-driven acid pulses, but do not change the initial âH+/O quotients. The increase in effective proton conductance of the M phase caused by these uncouplers accounts quantitatively for their uncoupling action; and the fact that the initial âH+/O quotients are unchanged shows that uncoupler-sensitive chemical intermediates do not exist between the respiratory-chain system and the effective proton-translocating mechanism. 6. Stoicheiometric acid--base changes associated with the activity of the regions of the respiratory chain on the oxygen side of the rotenone- and antimycin A-sensitive sites gives experimental support for a suggested configuration of loop 3.}},
