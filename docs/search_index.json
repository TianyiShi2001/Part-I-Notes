The techniques we describe mainly involve irradiating the specimen with electromagnetic radiation. They include: scattering (e.g. SAXS, SANS, DLS); refraction related phenomena (e.g. SPR); X-ray diffraction/crystallography; absorption and emission spectra (e.g. UV/visible, CD, fluorescence); magnetic resonance (NMR &amp; MRI); microscopy and experiments on single molecules (single pair FRET, optical ‘tweezers’ etc.). Other important biophysical methods, such as analytical ultracentrifugation, calorimetry and mass spectrometry, will be covered in other lecture courses. In general, physical methods can have relatively difficult associated concepts. You should realise that this course is an introduction to the methodology. By the end of the course you should understand something about the physical basis of the various methods discussed, how they are applied, and what information they can provide. The goal is that you will be able to get the gist of a paper in a scientific publication that uses one or more of these methods. This means that you should know the implications of some of the jargon used; e.g. “data collected to 2.8Å resolution” in an X-ray diffraction paper. Sources of help: All the Powerpoint lectures will be available on Weblearn and there is also a supplement there with useful Web-sites and links to relevant scientific papers (accessible through Oxford University on-line e-Journals). Basic textbooks, e.g. Alberts et al., cover some aspects of biophysical methods. However, some more specific books that describe biophysical techniques are recommended; e.g.: Campbell ID, Biophysical techniques. OUP, 2012. Branden and Tooze, Introduction to Protein Structure. Freeman (2nd edn.), 1998. Hammes G, Spectroscopy for the biological sciences. Wiley, 2005. Sheehan D, Physical Biochemistry. Wiley (2nd edn) 2009.

Of particular relevance to this course is material on structural biology, proteins, and the control of prokaryotic gene expression. To inform you of the diverse metabolic capabilities possessed by animal, bacterial and plant cells; To introduce you to the principles that underpin the diversity of metabolic processes that occur in different cell types; To introduce you to the types of control that regulate metabolic transformations. By the end of this course you should understand: Energy transduction by mitochondrial, bacterial and thylakoid membranes. The principles of, and the evidence for, the chemiosmotic theory; References: There are several Molecular Biology/Biochemistry textbooks that provide adequate factual material. None (other than perhaps ‘The Genetic Switch’) are good at providing a ‘feel’ for the strategies and approaches that lead to new discoveries and for consolidating these discoveries into biological understanding. Remember that knowing the facts is not enough; more important is knowing how we get to know the facts’.

OMPs OmpF, OmpC allow passive diffusion of small molecules such as mono- and disaccharides and amino acids 16 TM β strands exist as trimers very abundant; ~250000 copies per cell LamB (18 TM β strands) and PhoE (16 TM β strands) also exist as trimers funciton in the diffusion of specific small molecules, maltose or maltodextrins and anions such as \\(\\text{PO}_4^{3-}\\) OmpA another abundant OMP monomeric exist in two different conformations: a minor form with an unkown number of transmembrane strands can function as a porin, but the major, nonporin form has only 8 TM strands, and the periplasmic domain of this form performs a largely structural role An additional class of OMPs with 20-24 TM strands are present at much lower levels, and they function as gated channels in the high affinity transport of large ligands such as Fe-chelates or vitamins such as VB-12 Few enzymes Phospholipase (PldA) Protease (OmpT) LPS-modifying enzyme (PagP) 4.1.1.1 LPS LPS plays a critical role in the barrier function of the OM. It is a glucosamine disaccharide with 7 or 8 acyl chains, a polysaccharide core, and an extended polysaccharide chain that is called the O-antigen. The acyl chains are largedly saturated, and this facilitates tight packing The nonfluid continuum formed by the LPS molecules is a very effective barrier for hydrophobic molecules 4.1.2 The peptidoglycan cell wall Peptidyclycan is made up of repeating unites of the disaccharide N-acetyl glucosamine-N-acetyl muramic acid (NAG-NAM), which are cross-linked by pentapeptide side chains The OM is staped to the underlying peptidoglycan by a lipoprotein called Lpp. Lpp is th emost abundant protein in E. coli., more than 500,000 molecules per cell. 4.1.3 The inner membrane The IM is a phospholipid bilayder. In E. coli the principal phospholipids are phosphatidyl ethanolamine and phosphatidyl glycerol (lesser amounts of phosphatidylserine and cardiolipin) 4.1.4 The Gram-positive cell envelope Compared to Grame-negatives, Grame-posirives lack the outer membrane, and have a thicker cell wall composed of several of peptidoglycan many times thicker than is found in E. coli. Threading throuth these layers of peptidoglycan are long anionic polymers, called teichoic acids which are composed largely of glycerol phosphate, glucosyl phosphate, or ribitol phosphate repeats. Teichoic acids are divided into wall TA (WTA) and lipotechoic acid (LTA). WTA are covalently attached to peptidoglycan ; lipoteichoic acids are anchored to the head groups of membrane lipids. TA accound for over 60% of the mass of the G+ cell wall. The surfaces of G+ are decorated with a variety of proteins, some of which are analogous to proteins found in the periplasm of G- bacteria.

The transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but an evolutionary process of increasing complexity that involved: molecular self-replication (RNA introns and Qβ phage) self-assembly (no enzymes) autocatalysis (RNA enzymes and self-splicing RNA) emergence of cell membranes Assumption: all life forms descended from a single ancestral life from or progenote. Evidence: many essemtial building blocks of life could have assembled spontaneously from chemicals present on primitive Earth (prebiotic synthesis) paleobiologists show that the first fossil cells (microfossils) evolved from the prebiotically synthesised building blocks of life about 3-4 mya, when Earth was about 1-1.5 b yo based on analyses of meteorites, some components of RNA may have formed in space and arrived on Earth Molecular Fossils are structures (e.g. the placement of introns within a gene) or functions (e.g. the use of a particualr metabolic pathway or the composition of a membrane or the information processing systems) that are shared by such diverse organisms that they must have been present in the first cells, as well as in earlier pre-cellular forms of life. the rate at which genome sequences are being obtained means rapid process is being made in understanding evolution of modern organisms "],

One methyl group contributes very little to the binding energy and would allow discrimination only to an error level of 10-2 the recognition system therefore need two steps of discrimination independently, involving two separate attempts by the enzyme to recognise the amino acids the make the error frequency multiplicative, these must be separated by an irreversible (energy-requiring) step (hydrolysis of ATP) there are two different ways of achieving these two separate attempts at recognition: ‘pre-transfer editing’ and ‘post-transfer editing’ (hydrolytic editing) An example with the isoleucine tRNA synthetase: the first attemp at recognition is by the original choice of amino acid. The binding of Ile and formation of Ile-adenylate is only 102 better than binding of Val and formation of Val-adenylate the second step: the valyl-adenylate is hydrolysed by the enzyme much more rapidly than isoleucyl-adenylate — and does not proceed to tRNA reaction — so total discrimination if 104 A second example of hydrolytic editing occurs at a second active site on the synthetase and is illustrated by valyl-tRNA synthetase. The initial recognition of valine does not discriminate well against threonine, and after the formation of valyl/theonyl adenylate and then the aa tRNA, threonyl-tRNA is hydrolysed 3000 times faster than valyl-tRNA at a separate site on the enzyme. Also, in the presence of tRNAIle, there is &gt; 99% hydrolysis of the incorrectly activated valyl-tRNAIle This ‘double sieve’ sorts correct and incorrect charging. the first sieve invokes size and steric requirements. the second sieve invokes chemical characteristics.
